- Hi, I’m @JimMcGuire22

- I’m interested in Learning robotics, embedded systems, control systems (more specifically flight controls), ...
     electronics, and becoming not hot garbage at programming :).  I currently work in the aerospace ...
     industry, but minored in CS and currently am thinking about looking into aerospace control/embedded ...
     systems.  Any help with that would immediately make you a legend.  I also would really like to learn ...
     to work with servers and parallel computing and stuff.  

- I’m currently (trying to) learn how to work with micro-controllers ...
     (mostly arduino, teensy, and STM32/Nucleo - albeit mostly only have worked with arduino so far), ...
     be able to actually build modules for them, how to interact with hardware in general, and just ...
     really anything more on programming that I can since I am pretty new.
     
- I’m looking to collaborate on my tank project as of now, and I definitely will need help in pretty ...
     much all aspects of this project.  From ideas about the mechanical parts to the electronics and ...
     such. However, I love new projects and once I am done with this one I will probably get antsy ...
     and start looking for another.

- The skills I have are pretty begginner level. I have very limited arduino programming but have done some. ...
     I have worked with linux machine before for work and in a personal rig, but was very far from ...
     a power user and didn't do much modding of my .rc files or that much scripting.  I currently ...
     know MATLAB the best (just because of having to use it at work so much), python a little, ...
     used Java for a 2 classes in college, have done a few small projects in C++, and have dabbled with ...
     a few other languages.  I also use FreeCAD, (back when I had it) SOLIDWORKS, and just started learning...
     OpenSCAD.  I have worked with 3D printing a good bit.
